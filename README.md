# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Professional Degree - Project II

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

For this project, The dataset [Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
* Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
